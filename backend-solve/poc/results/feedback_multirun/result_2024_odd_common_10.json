Grok misread the problem as an arc-length computation and is incorrect. Note: the statement says f decreases on [0,a], but the computed behavior is increasing on [0,2], decreasing on (2,6), increasing on (6,∞); this likely reflects a minor wording issue in the prompt. The final numeric answer remains 17/2, so no changes were needed.",
