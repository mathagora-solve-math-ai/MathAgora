MathAgora is a platform that allows users to upload math exam sheets or problem sets, automatically **identify the document type** (e.g., CSAT, discrete mathematics, etc.), **detect individual question regions**, and generate and compare solutions from multiple **large language models (LLMs)** simultaneously.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload or Dataset Selection**  
  Upload a workbook or exam sheet image, or explore preloaded datasets by selecting a specific year and page.

- **Document Classification & Question Detection**  
  The system identifies the exam type from the uploaded image, detects individual problem regions, and extracts text via OCR.

- **Multi-Model Reasoning**  
  Multiple models — including GPT-5-Codex, GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Grok 4 Fast — generate solutions simultaneously for the selected problem, with streaming outputs.

- **Aligned Step-by-Step Solutions**  
  Each model’s strategy, intermediate steps, and final answer are structured and displayed in an aligned format, enabling step-level comparison across models.

- **FlowMap & Aggregation**  
  Visualize the reasoning process through FlowMap, or summarize and aggregate results across multiple models.

You can explore the full functionality through the live demo link above.
